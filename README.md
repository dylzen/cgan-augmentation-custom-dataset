# cgan-augmentation-custom-dataset

#### WARNING: this script is a work in progress and it's just for reference.

## Description

This is the script I wrote for my Computer Engineering thesis: [dylzen/elaborato_di_laurea](https://github.com/dylzen/elaborato_di_laurea)

It is a Machine Learning program written in Python with TensorFlow and Keras. 
We tried to evaluate the use of a CGAN for a data augmentation problem on a custom image dataset.
